# Installation Guide:

### Virtual Environment on Windows:

#### Run the script below within the directory to create the virtual environment:
> py -3 -m venv env

#### Start the virtual environment run the script below:
> source env/bin/activate
On cmd Windows within the main file:
>.\env\Scripts\activate 
#### Then, to stop it:
> deactivate

### Git Hub, to track dependencies:

#### Install all python libraries from requirements.txt:
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#### To export a list of all installed packages:
py -m pip freeze

### The routine for a python project on GitHub:
<ol>
<li>While in the virtual environment, start by installing a python library: </li>
> pip install library
<li>Then stop the virtual environment: </li>
> deactivate
<li>Initialize the repository: </li>
> git init
<li>To include the "env" folder in the .gitignore file so the virtual environment is ignored by source control: </li>
> echo â€˜env' > .gitignore
<li>To place the dependencies in a text file to be committed (Freezing reads all the installed dependencies and then produces a text file with the name of the dependency and the installed version number.): </li>
> pip freeze > requirements.txt
<li>To check the file into source control : </li>
> git add requirements.txt
<li>Finally, commit the files and push to a repo. </li>
</ol>

**Note:** MMF requires Python 3.9+
